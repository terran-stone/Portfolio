        <h1>Greetings!</h1>
        <p>My name is Terran Stone and I'd like to welcome you to my personal portfolio. 
          I was born and raised in the state of Maine, United States and have lived here all of my life.
          I'm an avid lover of the outdoors and enjoy many activities ranging from camping, motorsports, fishing and more.</p>

        <div id="aboutdiv2">
          <p>I'm currently enrolled in a bachelor's program at the University of Maine pursuing a degree in computer science and will be starting school in the fall of 2024. I have a professional background that ranges from former military, security, law enforcement, telecom-technician and more. Within the last year, I have finally decided to chase my passion for technology and coding.</p>
